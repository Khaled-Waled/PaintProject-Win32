# PaintProject-Computer Graphics- WIN32
A Paint program implementation using Win32 windows API.
## The project has the following requirements:
- Change the background of window to be white
- Choose shape color before drawing from menu
- Item to clear screen from shapes
- Save function for all data in screen
- Load function to load data from files
- Line algorithms [DDA, Midpoint and parametric]
- Circle algorithms (Direct, Polar, iterative Polar, midpoint and modified Midpoint)
- Filling Circle with lines after taking filling quarter from user
- Filling Circle with other circles after taking filling quarter from user
- Filling Square with Hermit Curve[Vertical]
- Filling Rectangle with Bezier Curve[horizontal]
- Convex and Non Convex Filling Algorithm
- Recursive and Non Recursive FloodFill
- Cardinal Spline Curve
- Ellipse Algorithms [Direct, polar and midpoint]
- Clipping algorithms using Rectangle as Clipping Window[Point ,Line, Polygon]
- Clipping algorithms using Square as Clipping Window[Point ,Line]
- Clipping algorithms using circle as Clipping Window[Point ,Line]
